人的记忆需要反复巩固，并且越熟悉之后需要复习巩固的间隔可以加长。对于记忆来说如此，对于很多技能的掌握也是如此。

Human's memory needs repetition to consolidate, and the space between repetitions can be longer when you become more familiar with the content. It is such for memory, and the same for many other skills.

Spaced Repetition 可以用在很多方面，比如背单词、刷算法等等。对文章、想法的打磨也可以用 Spaced Repetition，反复来做。每一次做的时候尽量保证质量，又不要太在意质量，卡住了就不要弄太久，而是以重复多次取胜。

Spaced Repetition can be used on many things, such as mastering foreign language vocabulary, cramming algorithm interview problems, etc. It can used for incremental writing/thinking too. Each time, you try your best to ensure the quality, but don't be too worried about the quality at the same time. If you are stuck, just look at the answers or skip. The conquer is won with repetitions.

对于很多我们觉得难的事情，其实和刷题的感觉是一样的。难者不会，会者不难。如果一个题目你已经刷了很多遍了，再遇到至少根本不慌，会很自信地知道思路和代码，最多是因为太自信反而有点粗心，但一般也能很快检查出来。

For many things that we feel hard, it is the same as cramming algorithm/math problems. It is difficult for those who have not mastered it, and easy for those who have mastered it. If you have a solved a problem many times, at least you won't panic when you see it again. You will be confidently, knowing the idea and code. You could even make small mistakes being a bit careless because you are too confident, but you should be able quickly figure it out.

公开讲话、面试等很多事情都是这样子的，有心理压力就是因为是做新题（新事物，不会是正常的）甚至是打周赛（没有熟练度的情况下，还有时间压力），如果能够以 Spaced Repetition 的心态来看，就好很多了。虽然总有一些事情是你从未准备过，也不会给你第二次机会，但是绝大部分事情都是能以 Spaced Repetition 的方式来做的。

Public speaking, interviewing are similar. Pressure is due to working on new problems (new things, it is normal that you can't solve it) or even contests (if you don't have the mastery, plus the time pressure). If you can see it through the lens of Spaced Repetition, you would be relieved. Although there will always be things that you have never prepared, and won't give you a second chance, but most things can be conquered in the Spaced Repetition way.
