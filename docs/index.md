Hello.
My name is Shao Wang.

I am a software engineer currently based in Melbourne. I have experience in Java, Python, cloud and ML/AI. Here are my notes, mainly about software development but also contain various other topics.

You can connect me onÂ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shao-wang/).

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time in nature, driving and explore new things.
